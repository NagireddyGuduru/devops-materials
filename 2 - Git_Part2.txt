git branch Release1
BRanch will be created from master -> Release1
-- Create a branch and switch to it immediately
git checkout -b Release2

-- By default it will switch to Release1 branch once you created , You need to switch it by checking it out
git checkout Release1  

-- Rename the created branch
git branch -m Release2 Release3

----------------TAGS-----------------------------------
-- In git tags are read only
-- Snapshot of a perticular revision number having a name and meant for read only

----------------------------------------------------------
-- To check the diff between staging area and git

-- see a revision changes

git show 5746aa0c14ddc1b6800ade2e566455ff7ed6434f

-- See the files changed by a commit
git diff-tree --name-only -r  5746aa0c14ddc1b6800ade2e566455ff7ed6434f

-- See line by line changes modified by users
git blame Hai.txt

------------STASHING
-- stash stores the  staged changes into a packgae and stores in memory, when ever u want to pull remote changes and want to apply the un staged changes you can do this
git stash 

-- Show list of stashes'
git stash list

-- Now run git status you wont be seeing the untaged changes
-- apply your stash packet
git stash pop or you can use the id as well as shown below  ( pop is always latest stash)
git stash apply stash@{0}

-- This may lead to conflicts , resolve conflicts manually
-- Once the conflict is resolved commit the chhanges

-- Delete the stash packet
git stash drop stash@{0}

--check whether stash packets are deleted or not
git stash list

---------- Other commands
--Remove Untracked files from  	
-- The below command shows wht are all files will be deleted
git clean -n   

-- delete them actually
git clean -f

-- Revert the unstaged changes
git checkout -- Hai.txt

-- Revert the added/ staged changes

--create a file and add it then run below command

-- You can move your HEAD to previos commits
git reset HEAD~1

*****-- To revert back to latest HEAD
git reset HEAD^1

--if you want your HEAD to original place  ( make sure u delete unstaged files)
git pull

git reset --hard   ( reset to HEAD but it will not delete the untracked files)

git clean -f -d    (cleans up everything and deletes untracked files)

-- Retrieve files from history
git show Release1:Hai.txt

--Restore a deleted  file in git repo
git checkout CommitID


--See the branch information of a remote repository ( origin - remote repo)
git remote show origin 

-- Track remote branching into local workign tree
git fetch /Pull

-- The git pull command performs a git fetch and git merge (or git rebase based on your Git settings). 
-- The git fetch does not perform any operations on your local branches. 
--You can always run the fetch command and review the incoming changes.

------------------- MERGING
-- Merge a branch changes into checkout branch
-- assume am in master now

git merge Release1

-- It performs some automatic merge, still u may end up with some conflicts
-- resolve them with 
git mergetool

-- Merge strategies
1. Ours
git merge -s ours Release2  
-- It ignored all changes from Release2

2. Ours with local changes but not Release2 changes
git merge -s recursive -X ours Release2

3. Theirs
git merge -s recursive -X theirs Release2
******************************
Install Tortoise Git and make sure C:\Users\YourMAchineNaMe\.gitconfig   fiel contains below lines

[merge]
tool = tortoise

[mergetool "tortoise"]
cmd = "TortoiseMerge.exe" -base:"$BASE" -theirs:"$REMOTE" -mine:"$LOCAL" -merged:"$MERGED"

********************************
------ Rebase
-- We can rebase a branch changes into another branch without having a commit
-- Assume we have some changes in master which are not there in Release1 branch
git checkout Release1
git rebase master

--The above commands will apply master changes into Release1
--Performing a rebase from one branch to another branch does not create a merge commit.

git checkout master
gti merge Release1  --> You dont find much changes

-- Rebase makes further merges easier.
-- if you rewrite more than one commit by rebasing, you have to test all of the rewritten commits since they are "rewritten" by the rebase algorithm. 
Since merge/rebase/cherry-pick are purely text-based and do not understand the semantics of these texts they can end up with logically incorrect results, 
so such commits always should be reviewed and tested in order to detect potential problems.
 Hence it might be more efficient to merge a long feature branch into upstream instead of rebasing it since with merge you only have to review and test a single commit: 
 the merge commit itself.  Whereas with rebase you have to review and test all rebased commits again

---Cherry-pick
 
-- You can point your master to some other branch single commit ( its something like you can copy that commit to master)

EX:
git checkout -b pickfile
touch pickfile
git add pickfile
git commit -m"some oick file"

-- second commit on same file
echo Hi >> pickfile
git add 
git commit

-- Now you see the log and capture the first commit id
git checkout master
git log

-- run below command to get pickfile branch first commit on master
git cherry-pick ebb46b7


---------- Patch sets
You can create a patch set of certain set of commands and can apply anywhere
ex:
--create a new branch
git branch mybranch
--use this new branch
git checkout mybranch
--make some changes
touch test05
-- change some content in an existing file
echo "new content for test01" >test01
--commit this to the branch
git add .
git commit -a -m "first commit in the branch" 

--- creates a patch set now
git format-patch origin/master

--this creates the file:
--patch 0001-First-commit-in-the-branch.patch 

--To apply this patch to your master branch in a different clone of the repository, switch to it and use the git apply command
git checkout master
git apply 0001-First-commit-in-the-branch.patch 

--patch is applied to master
--change can be committed
git add .
git commit -a -m "apply patch"
